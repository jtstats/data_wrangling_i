I downloaded the data and created a GitHub repo + local R project.

**How to move the datasets to my repo/directory?**
*Is https://help.github.com/en/articles/moving-a-file-to-a-new-location correct?*
**Follow the lecture, and just add the data files into the local R folder.**

```{r setup, include = FALSE}

# What does this mean?
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# load the library
library(tidyverse)

```

## Load in a dataset

```{r}
## reads in a dataset


```
